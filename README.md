The project aims to investigate and understand the funding dynamics within the Indian startup ecosystem over the years 2018 to 2021. By analyzing the provided datasets, which include details such as company names, sectors, funding amounts, and investor information, the goal is to discern patterns and trends in the distribution of funding across various sectors.
By focusing on different sectors, we seek to unravel insights into the variations in funding amounts and trends. This analysis is crucial for stakeholders, including investors, policymakers, and entrepreneurs, as it provides actionable intelligence on the distribution of financial support among diverse sectors, ultimately informing strategic decision-making within the dynamic landscape of the Indian startup ecosystem.
